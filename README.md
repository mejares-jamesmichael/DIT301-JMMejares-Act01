## 1. What challenges did you face installing Android Studio?

- I can't really give an in-depth feedback with this question as I did not explicitly installed Android Studio on my machine. What I did was a workaround  method, I know that installing Android Studio on my machine would be a huge painstaking task that will cause some frustrating problems. The android emulator aka GUI AVD is quite a resource intensive process so with that reason, it's a NO GO for me. In order to do mobile development and also to run and test the app, I utlized my android device and used it as the machine that will run the app instead of emulating it with the help of the emulator from Android Studio.

## 2. What did you learn about Android app structure?

- Since I used flutter for this project, the Android Structure probably varies from a typical native android app structure from what we commonly see from projects produced from Android Studio. In a Flutter Project, I noticed  that there are several files that are segregated that make up the android app structure.  The lib/ directory is where the dart code lives and based from my first hand experience, the main.dart file is what I modified to change what to display on a mobile devices and what text to print.  Furthermore, there is also an Android-specific directory which is the android/, based from my research, it is a full-fledged gradle based android project that wraps the flutter project so it can run on android. It contains the most significant key parts for an android app to run such as configs, resources, and the code. To sum it all up, I learned a lot of stuff that makes up the entirety of an Android app, all the components that plays significant roles to launch and make a functioning app.
